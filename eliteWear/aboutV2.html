      <p>My name is Dhruv Shah and I'm a sophomore studying Finance and Biology at Rutgers University. I started Elite Wear with the aim to provide people with a product they would feel comfortable wearing anytime. I'm a fan of streetwear but I feel that it's too flashy at times, so I wanted to design subtle shirts that look great and catch people's attention. The designs focus on simplicity and elegance to carry them forth and help them shine among all others. </p>

    <p>Q: Are the designs original?</p>

    <p>Q: Are sizes true to fit?</p>
    <p>A: Yes, sizes are true to fit so that you won't have to worry about shrinkage or funky sizing.</p>
    <p>Q: Why “Elite”?</p>
    <p>A: “Elite” conveys power and confidence, giving wearers an extra boost to make each day better than their last.</p>
    <p>Q: What is the return and exchange policy?</p>
    <p>A: Unfortunately, returns are not available yet. Exchanges are limited to NJ for the time being. Once they are available elsewhere, the policy will be changed immediately. Hopefully, you are happy with your purchase and don't have to refer to this policy.</p>
    <p>Q: Are there shipping costs?</p>
    <p>A: Yes, domestic shipping is provided for a small fee of $7.50. Students at Rutgers University can avoid this fee by indicating current Rutgers student status during checkout and picking up the shirt(s) conveniently on campus.</p>
    <p>Q: Which payment methods are supported? </p>
    <p>A: If purchasing through the website, the two payment methods are via Paypal or Credit Card. All transactions are secure and security is handled by Paypal.</p>
